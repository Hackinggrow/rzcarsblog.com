      <h2>Design Flaws, Not Defects, Bug Car Owners The Most</h2>
      <p> Cars just don't break down as much as they used to, especially in the first few months of ownership. But that doesn't mean car buyers are always satisfied with their purchase.

        Nearly two-thirds of the problems owners experience with their new vehicle in the first 90 days are design-related rather than manufacturing defects, according to the J.D. Power 2013 U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS). A component may be working as designed, for example, but if it's difficult to understand or operate, owners may report it as a problem.
        
        And good luck getting such issues fixed at the dealership. When owners take their vehicle to a dealership for a design-related issue, the problem is fixed only 13 percent of the time, J.D. Power found. When there's a component malfunction, the dealership is able to fix it 42 percent of the time.
        
        Many of the problems owners have with their vehicle are technology-related, including voice recognition or hands-free technology, Bluetooth pairing for mobile phones, or the navigation system, among others. “Automakers are investing billions of dollars into designing and building vehicles and adding technologies that consumers desire and demand, but the risk is that the vehicle design, or the technology within the vehicle, in some cases may not meet customer needs,” said David Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power.</p>
      <h3>SOFTWARE FOR DESIGN</h3>
      <p>A salesperson might be able to resolve some technology-related problems by doing a better job explaining the system, and others may be remedied with software changes, as Ford Motor has found with its MyFord Touch system. The company has been dogged by complaints since introducing the system a couple of years ago, prompting several updates. A downloadable upgrade is planned for this summer. The company says previous upgrades already have helped improve quality perceptions by more than 50 percent, but such perceptions have yet to show up in the J.D. Power study; Ford still ranks below average, near the bottom of the heap. However, Sargent noted that "Ford has worked as hard as it is possible to work" to improve its system and that he expects Ford's initial quality scores will improve quickly.

        Unfortunately for many vehicle owners, they are often stuck with frustrating design flaws for the life of the vehicle. A problematic smartphone, on the other hand, can be replaced fairly easily. </p>
