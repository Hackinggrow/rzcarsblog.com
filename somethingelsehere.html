        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Radar safety system protects only 7 per cent of UK smart motorways. <span class="text-muted">It’ll blow your mind.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">The UK government has pledged to make smart motorways safer by rolling out a radar detection system within the next three years, but New Scientist can reveal that this is in place on just 7 per cent of roads today.

            Smart motorways involve more direct traffic management measures than conventional ones, including variable speed limits to ease congestion and the use of hard shoulders when traffic is slowing. They are enforced by cameras, with information conveyed to drivers via gantries.
            
            The shift to smart motorways has been rolled out across the UK to ease traffic flow, but there has been recent criticism that many of them lack a hard shoulder, making them unsafe in the event of cars breaking down.
            
            
            The Department for Transport (DfT) today set out an 18-point plan for making the UK’s smart motorways safer. Chief among those steps is speeding up the roll-out of a radar detection system across the roads within 36 months, which transport secretary Grant Shapps said was the first time a clear public timetable had been set to do so.
            
            However, a New Scientist freedom of information (FOI) request to Highways England shows how little of the network is already covered by the system. Of the 640 kilometres of smart motorways, just 45 km, across two schemes on the M25, are equipped with radar detection. The measure is meant to spot stopped vehicles in 20 seconds and quickly close the lane, to avoid collisions.</p>

        <p class="lead">ELECTRIC cars have several advantages over gas guzzlers, but having to plug them in every day isn’t one of them. The good news is that you may not need to – all electric cars could soon come with wireless chargers.

            “I won’t buy a car I have to plug in again,” says engineer Olaf Simon, who organised a trial of wireless charging in Berlin, Germany. “Wireless charging is so convenient.”
            
            In fact, this type of charging may offer more than just greater convenience, …</p>

With the age of the fossil-fuel car drawing to an end, electric vehicles (EVs) from China could be on track for global dominance – assuming that the hundreds of start-ups in the sector don’t skid out and crash.</p>
